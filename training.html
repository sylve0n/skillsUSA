            <h2>Dog Training Classes</h2>
            <strong>Classes will be held at Lucky Dog Daycare &amp; Boarding on Tuesday, 
               Wednesday and Thursday evenings.</strong>
            <p>Most group training consists of six 55-minute classes. 
               A new client orientation is included for anyone starting 
               Puppy Kindergarten and Beginning Obedience.</p>
            <p>Class content, leadership and training equipment are all discussed at orientation.
                We also touch on common issues such as mouthiness, housebreaking, crate training and jumping. 
                Come prepared with questions.</p>
            <p><strong>Attending orientation is important</strong> so that you have a good foundation for your first class. 
               If you are not able to attend orientation, you must make arrangements to pick up your 
               orientation packet or have it emailed to you before you start your first class. 
               All orientations are held in our Plainfield location.</p>
            
            <p>Adopted dogs receive a 10% discount. (Proof of adoption required at the time of registration.)
