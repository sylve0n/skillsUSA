                <q class="clearfix-overflow">My husband and I both work full time jobs. We didn't think it was fair to make her sit at home for 10 hours until we got home. Lucky Dog has allowed all three of us to have the best of both worlds. We get to have the companionship and unconditional love of a dog and Penny gets to play all day and then come home to a family that adores her. The owners and staff are well versed in dog behavior. When I pick Penny up they are more than willing to provide honest feedback about how Penny conducts herself with other dogs and humans. It's truly a place for Lucky Dogs!</q>

                <q class="clearfix-overflow">Talk about a Lucky Dog (or dogs in our case). Harper and Deacon have become a Lucky Dog success story. Having 2 high- energy puppies (Dobermans) that need massive amounts of stimulation and exercise, and 2 parents who workâ€¦What to do? We enrolled our furry "children" in Lucky Dogs daycare program 3-4 days a week and saw dramatic change in their behavior for the good. The puppies no longer fought with each other, were much calmer around the house and more social with everyone and everything all around. Dog training classes are also offered on site and proved to be both convenient and extremely useful. Give Lucky Dog a chance, and make your dog one of the &quot;lucky ones.&quot;</q>
